## Description
Welcome! My name is Michael Rath and this is my web forum application I completed as project 2 while attending the Microsoft Software & Systems Academy. A web based forum for topics related to NASA and space travel. Users can browse a list of recent events, NASA imagery and recordings, and link to the forum for discussion. Project uses data validation, data storage and retrieval through entity framework, and user authentication and authorization.

## Technologies
Project is created with
* .Net 6.0
* C#
* Javascript
* SQL
* Entity Framework
* HTML/CSS
* Bootstrap

## Roadmap
* As this was a classroom assignment, I have no further plans for additions or improvements
